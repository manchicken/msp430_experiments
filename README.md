msp430_experiments
==================

Here's where I'm teaching my self how to hack the MSP430 (currently for the MSP430G2553)

MSP430 Programs
===============
## toggle_leds_with_button.430 ##
This program toggles P1.0 and P1.6 with each push of P1.3.

## light_patterns.430 ##
The goal of this is to learn how to use the timer and make patterns of P1.0 and P1.6 appear.

Other Stuff
===========
## bitmath.osx ##
A program I'm using to double-check my math and use of operators.

## gdbmsp ##
This script is just a shortcut for loading GDB with my program.
